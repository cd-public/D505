## Agenda

1. Python Overview
2. Review of Regression
3. Classification
4. Basic Feature Engineering

## Quarto

-   I switch from a R backend to a Python backend.
-   I add the following below my title in my .qmd header:
```
jupyter: python3
```



## Pip

-   In Python, we can typically install packages via `pip`
-   It is much typical to use `pip` at commandline.
```bash
python -m pip install sampleproject
```
-   Here is a "clean" way to do so from within the Python
```{python}
import subprocess  # A base package we need to install other packages
import sys         # A base package we need to install other packages
install = lambda package : subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, 
                                                  "-m", 
                                                  "pip", 
                                                  "install", 
                                                  package])
```


## Packages

- I'll build a list of packages at install them via a loop.
```{python}
import subprocess
import sys

install = lambda package : subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", package])

```

## Setup

- We will work with a `wine` dataset that is enormous.
  - Just to render a bit quickly, take a sample.
  - You are welcome to work with the [full dataset](https://cd-public.github.io/courses/rmls25/dat/wine.rds)!

```{r Setup}
wine <- readRDS(gzcon(url("https://cd-public.github.io/courses/rmls25/dat/wine.rds")))
wine <- wine %>% drop_na(points, price)
# performance concession
# wall <- wine
# wine = wall[sample(nrow(wall), 100), ]
summary(wine)
```

# Review of Regression

## Single Variable

- Pick the poshest province.
```{r Single Variable}
wine <- wine %>%
  mutate(bordeaux = (province == "Bordeaux"))
wine <- wine %>% drop_na(bordeaux)
top_n(wine, 10, bordeaux)
```

## Regress
- Take a quick regression model over the wine.
```{r Regress}
m1 <- lm(price ~ points, data = wine)
get_regression_table(m1)
```
## Let's draw it

```{r Lets draw it 1}
#| echo: false
wine %>%
  mutate(m1 = predict(m1)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_smooth(aes(points, price)) +
  geom_line(aes(points, m1), size = 2, color = "orange") +
  labs(
    title = "Regression of Price on Points",
    x = "Points", y = "Price"
  )
```

## Multiple regression

```{r Multiple regression}
m2 <- lm(price ~ points + bordeaux, data = wine)
get_regression_table(m2)
```

## Let's draw it

```{r Lets draw it 2}
#| echo: false
wine %>%
  mutate(m2 = predict(m2)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_smooth(aes(points, price)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = points, y = m2, color = bordeaux), size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Multiple Regression of Price on Points and Bordeaux",
    x = "Points", y = "Price"
  )
```

## How about with an interaction?

```{r Interaction}
m3 <- lm(price ~ points * bordeaux, data = wine)
get_regression_table(m3)
```

## Let's draw it
```{r Lets draw it 3}
#| echo: false
wine %>%
  mutate(m3 = predict(m3)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_smooth(aes(points, price)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = points, y = m3, color = bordeaux), size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Interaction Model: Price on Points and Bordeaux",
    x = "Points", y = "Price"
  )
```


## Model diagnostics 

```{r Diagnostics}
get_regression_summaries(m1)
get_regression_summaries(m2)
get_regression_summaries(m3)
```

# Moving to an ML framework

## Split sample using Caret

```{r Caret}
set.seed(505)
train_index <- createDataPartition(wine$price, times = 1, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
train <- wine[train_index, ]
test <- wine[-train_index, ]
head(test)
```

## Compare RMSE across models
- Retrain on models on the training set
```{r Models} 
ms <- list(
  lm(price ~ points, data = train),
  lm(price ~ points + bordeaux, data = train),
  lm(price ~ points * bordeaux, data = train)
)
```
- Test them all under the same conditions.

```{r RMSE}
map(ms, function(m) {
  get_regression_points(m, newdata = test) %>%
    drop_na(residual) %>%
    mutate(sq_residuals = residual^2) %>%
    summarize(rmse = sqrt(mean(sq_residuals))) %>%
    pluck("rmse")
}) %>% unlist()
```
<!--
## Compare RMSE across models

```r
get_regression_points(lm(price~points, data = train), newdata = test) %>% 
  drop_na(residual) %>%   mutate(sq_residuals = residual^2) %>% 
  summarize(rmse = sqrt(mean(sq_residuals))) %>% pluck("rmse")
```
```r
get_regression_points(lm(price~points+bordeaux, data = train), newdata = test) %>% 
  drop_na(residual) %>%   mutate(sq_residuals = residual^2) %>% 
  summarize(rmse = sqrt(mean(sq_residuals))) %>% pluck("rmse")
```

```r
get_regression_points(lm(price~points*bordeaux, data = train), newdata = test) %>%   
  drop_na(residual) %>%  mutate(sq_residuals = residual^2) %>% 
  summarize(rmse = sqrt(mean(sq_residuals))) %>% pluck("rmse")
```
-->

# Classification and Ethics 

## The math of it...

- Suppose I'm trying to predict sex based on height.
  - Don't do this in real life (obviously).
- We start by 
  - defining the outcome and predictors, and...
  - creating training and test data.

## Partition our Data

```{r Partition}
data(heights) # from library(dslabs)
y <- heights$sex
x <- heights$height
set.seed(505)
test_index <- createDataPartition(y, times = 1, p = 0.5, list = FALSE)
test_set <- heights[test_index, ]
train_set <- heights[-test_index, ]
summary(heights)
```

Note: this vignette is adapted from [this book](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/introduction-to-machine-learning.html)

## Guessing

- Let’s start by developing the simplest possible machine algorithm: guessing the outcome.
```{r Guessing}
y_hat <- sample(c("Male", "Female"), length(test_index), replace = TRUE)
```
Recall:

>[Y hat (written ŷ ) is the predicted value of y (the dependent variable) in a regression equation. It can also be considered to be the average value of the response variable.](https://www.statisticshowto.com/y-hat-definition/)

## Accuracy
- The overall accuracy is simply defined as the overall proportion that is predicted correctly:
```{r Accuracy}
mean(y_hat == test_set$sex)
```
- What would we have expected the accuracy to be?
  - What much would we have expected accuracy to deviate from that expectionation?


## Let's do better...

```{r Better}
summary <- heights %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(mean(height), sd(height))
summary
```

## A simple predictive model

- Idea: Predict `"Male"` if observation is within 2 standard deviations

```{r Predict}
male_mean_less_2sd <- summary[2, ]["mean(height)"] - 2 * summary[2, ]["sd(height)"]

y_hat <- ifelse(x > male_mean_less_2sd, "Male", "Female") %>%
  factor(levels = levels(test_set$sex))

c(male_mean_less_2sd, mean(y == y_hat))
```

- The accuracy goes up from ~0.50 to about ~0.80!!

## Let's optimize

```{r Optimize}
cutoff <- seq(61, 70)
get_accuracy <- function(x) {
  y_hat <- ifelse(train_set$height > x, "Male", "Female")
  mean(y_hat == train_set$sex)
}
accuracy <- map(cutoff, get_accuracy)

unlist(accuracy)
```

- Most are much higher than 0.5!! 

## Let's take a gander
- Easier for me to see it.
```{r Gander}
plot(cutoff, accuracy)
```

## Optimal Cutoff

```{r Best cutoff}
best_cutoff <- cutoff[which.max(accuracy)]
best_cutoff
```
- Should we be cutting at an integer?

## Apply & Evaluate

```{r Cutoff test}
y_hat <- ifelse(test_set$height > best_cutoff, "Male", "Female")
mean(y_hat == test_set$sex)
```


## Confusion matrix
```{r Matrix}
table(predicted = y_hat, actual = test_set$sex) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = predicted, y = actual)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = Freq), color = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "blue") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Freq), vjust = "center", color = "black", size = 24) +
  labs(title = "Confusion Matrix", x = "Predicted", y = "Actual")
```

## Accuracy by sex

```{r Accuracy by sex}
test_set %>%
  mutate(y_hat = y_hat) %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(accuracy = mean(y_hat == sex))
```
&nbsp;

It's raining men.

## Jameson on Ethics
<blockquote>
Reasonable people will disagree over subtle matters of right and wrong... thus, the important part of data ethics is committing to *consider* the ethical consequences of your choices. 

The difference between "regular" ethics and data ethics is that algorithms scale really easily. Thus, seemingly small decisions can have wide-ranging impact.
</blockquote>

## Calvin on Ethics

> No ethical \[computation\] under capitalism

- Usage of data `|` computing is ethicial `iff` it challenges rather than strengthens existing power relations.

::::

## **Features**  
- **Definition:** Individual measurable properties or attributes of data.  
- **Example:** Age, income, and education level in a dataset predicting loan approval.  

## **Variables**  
- **Definition:** Data points that can change and impact predictions.  
- **Example:** Independent variables like weather, and dependent variables like crop yield.  

## **Outcome Variable**  
- **Definition:** The target or dependent variable the model predicts.  
- **Example:** Predicting "passed" or "failed" for a student's exam result.  

## Features vs. Variables  
- **Features:** Inputs to the model, often selected or engineered from raw data.  
  - Example: "Average monthly income" derived from raw transaction data.  
- **Variables:** Broader term encompassing both inputs (independent) and outputs (dependent).  
  - Example: "House price" (dependent variable) depends on features like size and location.

## **Regression**  
- **Definition:** Statistical method to model the relationship between variables.  
- **Example:** Linear regression predicts house prices based on size and location.  

## **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**  
- **Definition:** A metric to measure prediction accuracy by averaging squared errors.  
- **Example:** Lower RMSE in predicting drug response indicates a better model fit.  

## **Classification**  
- **Definition:** Task of predicting discrete categories or labels.  
- **Example:** Classifying emails as "spam" or "not spam."  

## **Confusion Matrix**  
- **Definition:** A table showing model performance in classification tasks.  
- **Example:** Matrix rows show true values; columns show predicted outcomes.  
```{r Matrix Deux}
#| echo: false
table(predicted = y_hat, actual = test_set$sex) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = predicted, y = actual)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = Freq), color = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "blue") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Freq), vjust = "center", color = "black", size = 24) +
  labs(title = "Confusion Matrix", x = "Predicted", y = "Actual")
```

## **Split Samples**  
- **Definition:** Dividing data into training and testing subsets for validation.  
- **Example:** 80% training, 20% testing ensures unbiased model evaluation.  
```r
test_set <- heights[test_index, ]
train_set <- heights[-test_index, ]
```
