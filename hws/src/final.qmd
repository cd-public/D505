# Goal

*This is a generalized ML assignment*

1. Predict the profit of future products developed at CravenSpeed
2. Using any model (or ensemble) you'd like
3. Evaluated using RMSE on holdout sample (you won't see)

::: {.callout-important}
Predict the profit of "future products developed at CravenSpeed"
:::

# Criteria

- Every group member must participate in the presentation
- Maximum 10 features including interactions

# Assessment

- Assessments will be setup as follows:
    - "Profit" is engineered.
    - Note that the first ten (10) features are selected.
    - This ensures no more than 10 features are used.
    - "Profit" is incorporated into the data frame.

```{.r}
profit <- fast["Revenue 2019 to present"] - fast["BOM Cost"] * fast["Units Sold"]
fast <- fast %>% engineer()
fast <- fast |> select(1:10) # Max 10 features
fast["Profit"] = profit
```

## Information leaks

- Recall the following slides: [Overfittingâ€¦ or a leak?](https://cd-public.github.io/D505/lec/Session03.html#/overfitting-or-a-leak)

- I find it unreasonable to conclude that any of the following could be known about a product *before it is developed*:
    - These are indices `2:29,38,41`

```{.r}
 [1] "First Order (from sales data)" "src_www"
 [3] "src_iphone"                    "src_android"
 [5] "src_ipad"                      "src_manual"
 [7] "src_facebookshop"              "src_external"
 [9] "src_Amazon FBM"                "January"
[11] "February"                      "March"
[13] "April"                         "May"
[15] "June"                          "July"
[17] "August"                        "September"
[19] "October"                       "November"
[21] "December"                      "pct_Direct Sales"
[23] "pct_Orders for Stock"          "pct_Drop Shipments"
[25] "pct_Platypus"                  "pct_Moss Motors Only"
[27] "pct_R&D Club"                  "Units Sold"
[29] "Revenue 2019 to present"       "Sales Channel"
```

- That is, it is not meaningful to predict profit from metrics that can only be gathered if profit is known.
- I find it reasonable to considering the following:

```{.r}
 [1] "lookupId"                         "Base Product Sku"
 [3] "Listing Type"                     "Unit Weight (pounds)"
 [5] "retailPrice"                      "make"
 [7] "model"                            "yearMin"
 [9] "yearMax"                          "Number of Components"
[11] "BOM Cost"                         "Product Type"
[13] "Designer"                         "Main Component Material"
[15] "Main Component MFG Process"       "Main Component Finishing Process"
```

- For this reason, I have included only these fields in the `secret` hold-out data.
    - Profit, precomputed, is also present (of course).

# Assessment

- Assessments will be evaluated via RMSE over the secret data as follows:

```{.r}
train(Profit ~ .,
      data = fast, 
      method = "lm",
      trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5))$results$RMSE
```
