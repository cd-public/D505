You have a very large dataset with many hundreds of features, but you are worried that including indicators like age, income or gender might pose some ethical problems. When you discuss these concerns with your boss, she tells you to simply drop those features from the model. Does this solve the ethical issue? Why or why not?\n\n> <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:bold\">TODO</span>: *describe your reasoning here*\n",
