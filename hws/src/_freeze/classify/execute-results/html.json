Logistic Concepts\n\nWhy do we call it Logistic Regression even though we are using the technique for classification?\n\n> <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:bold\">TODO</span>: *Explain.*\n\n# 3. Modeling\n\nWe train a logistic regression algorithm to classify a whether a wine comes from Marlborough using:\n\n1. An 80-20 train-test split.\n2. Three features engineered from the description\n3. 5-fold cross validation.\n\nWe report Kappa after using the model to predict provinces in the holdout sample.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# TODO\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# 4. Binary vs Other Classification\n\nWhat is the difference between determining some form of classification through logistic regression versus methods like $K$-NN and Naive Bayes which performed classifications.\n\n> <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:bold\">TODO</span>: *Explain.*\n\n\n# 5. ROC Curves\n\nWe can display an ROC for the model to explain your model's quality.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# You can find a tutorial on ROC curves here: https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-auc-roc-curve-68b2303cc9c5\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n> <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:bold\">TODO</span>: *Explain.*\n",
