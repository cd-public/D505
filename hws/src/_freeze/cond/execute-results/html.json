Naive Bayes Algorithm\n\nWe train a naive bayes algorithm to classify a wine's province using:\n1. An 80-20 train-test split.\n2. Three features engineered from the description\n3. 5-fold cross validation.\n\nWe report Kappa after using the model to predict provinces in the holdout sample.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# TODO\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# 4. Frequency Differences\n\nWe find the three words that most distinguish New York Pinots from all other Pinots.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# TODO\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# 5.
