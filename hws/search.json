When you discuss these concerns with your boss, she tells you to simply drop those features from the model. Does this solve the ethical issue? Why or why not?\n\nNo - the only approach to resolve an ethical problem to is to “do the right thing” - which in this case is to take concrete actions to ensure the best possible outcomes for the individuals in question and nation-state/region as a whole. Modeling is insufficient to achieve a outcome consistent with ethical standards, which requires concrete actions with material implications. For example, one could share the results of a model on background with a reporter to apply political pressure the presidential administration to pressure the government to pursue verifiably sound industrial and economic policy."

This is reflected in drastically more accurate Kappa values for Naive Bayes, which are reflective, to me, of public universities as a rule being on the same side of the means across various metrics as other public universities.\n\n\n\nClassification Techniques\n\nPredict whether a college is Private.\nUse model weights.\nDisplay and comment on an ROC curve.\n\n\ncounts &lt;- table(df_knn$Private)\ncount_y &lt;- counts[\"Yes\"]\ncount_n &lt;- counts[\"No\"]\nweigh_y &lt;- max(count_y,count_n)/count_y\nweigh_n &lt;- max(count_y,count_n)/count_n\n\nc(count_y,count_n,weigh_y,weigh_n)\n\n       Yes         No        Yes         No \n565.000000 212.000000   1.000000   2.665094 \n\n\n\ntrain_knn &lt;- train_knn %&gt;% \n               mutate(weight=ifelse(Private==\"Yes\", weigh_y, weigh_n))\n\nfit_weights = train(Private ~ .,\n                    data = train_knn %&gt;% select(-weight), \n                    method = \"naive_bayes\",\n                    tuneLength = 15,\n                    metric = \"Kappa\",\n                    trControl = control,\n                    weights = train_knn$weight)\n\nconfusionMatrix(predict(fit_weights, test_knn),factor(test_knn$Private))\n\nConfusion Matrix and Statistics\n\n          Reference\nPrediction  No Yes\n       No   28   8\n       Yes  14 105\n                                         \n               Accuracy : 0.8581         \n                 95% CI : (0.793, 0.9089)\n    No Information Rate : 0.729          \n    P-Value [Acc &gt; NIR] : 9.277e-05      \n                                         \n                  Kappa : 0.6239         \n                                         \n Mcnemar's Test P-Value : 0.2864         \n                                         \n            Sensitivity : 0.6667         \n            Specificity : 0.9292         \n         Pos Pred Value : 0.7778         \n         Neg Pred Value : 0.8824         \n             Prevalence : 0.2710         \n         Detection Rate : 0.1806         \n   Detection Prevalence : 0.2323         \n      Balanced Accuracy : 0.7979         \n                                         \n       'Positive' Class : No             \n                                         \n\n\n\nIn this case, where we had relatively high predictive power to find both private and non-private colleges or universities without weights, adding weights actually disrupted this process and reduced our Kappa. Using weights is not effective in all cases - there are many private colleges and universities, and maybe many different kinds of colleges and universities we find through nearest neighbors or naive bayes, and it is unhelpful to apply weights to public colleges and universities which we already identified relatively effective. It may be worthwhile, however, to add something like a “college or university” feature or something of this nature to further differentiate types of institutions.\n\n\n\nEthics\n\nBased on your analysis, comment on the for-profit privatization of education, perhaps through the framework advanced by this article:\n\n\nIn mid-May 2018, The New York Times reported that under DeVos, the size of the team investigating abuses and fraud by for-profit colleges was reduced from about twelve members under the Obama administration to three, with their task also being scaled back to “processing student loan forgiveness applications and looking at smaller compliance cases”.\n\n\nDiscuss the civic reposibilities of data scientists for:\n\nBig Data and Human-Centered Computing\nDemocratic Institutions\nEducation and Educational Policy\n\nProvide at least one statistical measure for each, such as a RMSE, Kappa value, or ROC curve.\n\n\nBig Data and Human-Centered Computing\n\nWe note that private institutions make up 73% of institutions while educating 43% of students. From our earlier work, we note that private/public predicts graduation rate, and these institutions may be weakly differentiated with regards to measures like acceptance rate, instuctor educational attainment, and cost. A data driven approach to policy may want to investigate closely whether private schools, which enjoy non-profit status and federal loan assistance, are serving students better, or worse, given their lower level of regulatory oversight.\n\n\nlist(\n    sum(filter(College, Private == \"Yes\")$Enroll)/sum(College$Enroll),\n    count(filter(College, Private == \"Yes\"))/count(College)\n)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 0.4260023\n\n[[2]]\n          n\n1 0.7271557\n\n\n\nWe note that public institutions have dramatically lower cost, including for out-of-state students, in aggregate, possible due to their obligation to serve the broader public through the democratic process. A strong claim, which is partially but not fully supported here, is that democratic pressures dramatically expand access and cut costs, but this at least appears true for the specific niche of higher education.\n\n\n\nDemocratic Institutions\n\nlist(\n    mean(filter(df_knn, Private == \"Yes\")$Cost),\n    mean(filter(df_knn, Private == \"No\")$Cost)\n)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 18149.78\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 12793.01\n\n\n\n\nEducation and Educational Policy\n\nWe note that private universities achieve dramatically lower student-to-faculty ratios, roughly in line with their higher costs…\n\n\nlist(\n    mean(filter(College, Private == \"Yes\")$S.F.Ratio),\n    mean(filter(College, Private == \"No\")$S.F.Ratio)\n)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 12.94549\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 17.13915\n\n\n\nYet we do not see lower student-to-faculty ratios necessarily corresponding to a higher graduation rate.\n\n\nlm(Grad.Rate ~ S.F.Ratio, College)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Grad.Rate ~ S.F.Ratio, data = College)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)    S.F.Ratio  \n     84.217       -1.331  \n\n\n\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nAs data scientists with a private school affiliation, we should advocate strongly for democratic process within our institution and our region."

    "text": "2. \\(K\\)NN Concepts\n\nGenerally we regard selection of appropriate \\(K\\) as similar to the context of precision and recall, discussed in earlier post. However with \\(K\\)NN we have a slightly different trade-off - between bias, where the model is overgeneralized and begins to lose nuance in niche cases, and variance, where a model captures noise within the data set and extrapolates it to the population. Small \\(K\\) values tend to high variance, and larger \\(K\\) values tend to high bias."

Improvement\nHow can we interpret the confusion matrix, and how can we improve in our predictions?\n\nFor me, confusion between specifical Californian and Oregonian wins both jumps out numerical and is consistent with my own understand of the world - Both California and Oregon share a border on the Pacific coast of the United States, and are likely planting in similar volcanic soil in the temperate climate zones. They likely even experience similar rainfall! To differentiate specifically these two easily confusable wins, I think I should look into dedicated features that specifical capture the essense of the difference between California and Oregonian wins. Secondly, I notes that almost no wins are predicted to be in Marlborough or Casablanca - which isn’t too surprising with a \\(K\\) getting pretty close to the number of wines from those regions as a whole! I would need either more data or more advanced numerical techniques to differentiate wines within in regions from the overwhelming popular California and Oregon wines."
