We find that in fact the more the points, the more value we get from a cherry note - by a small but meaningful amount.

When you discuss these concerns with your boss, she tells you to simply drop those features from the model. Does this solve the ethical issue?

Modeling is insufficient to achieve a outcome consistent with ethical standards, which requires concrete actions with material implications. For example, one could share the results of a model on background with a reporter to apply political pressure the presidential administration to pressure the government to pursue verifiably sound industrial and economic policy."

Improvement\nHow can we interpret the confusion matrix, and how can we improve in our predictions?\n\nFor me, confusion between specifical Californian and Oregonian wins both jumps out numerical and is consistent with my own understand of the world - Both California and Oregon share a border on the Pacific coast of the United States, and are likely planting in similar volcanic soil in the temperate climate zones. They likely even experience similar rainfall! To differentiate specifically these two easily confusable wins, I think I should look into dedicated features that specifical capture the essense of the difference between California and Oregonian wins. Secondly, I notes that almost no wins are predicted to be in Marlborough or Casablanca - which isn’t too surprising with a \\(K\\) getting pretty close to the number of wines from those regions as a whole! I would need either more data or more advanced numerical techniques to differentiate wines within in regions from the overwhelming popular California and Oregon wines."
